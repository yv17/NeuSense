                    In this illusion, you will hear a series of note constantly rising in pitch. <br>

                    How? What you hear is impossible, in reality the pitches do not infinitely increase in pitch. 
                    One way to create a Shepard scale is by layering three sequences of tones; 
                    the sequences start from the same note and rise in pitch but they differ by one octave. <br>
                    
                    Insert a picture/diagram illustrating the above <br>
                    
                    The higher octave sequence fades from 100% volume to 0%. 
                    The lower octave rises from 0% to 100% volume and the middle sequence is constant at 100% volume. <br>
                    
                    You always hear two sequences with a pitch difference. 
                    Your brain uses one as a reference and, from the other, infers that the pitch is rising. 
                    The fading volumes means you do not register the sequences beginning or ending. 
                    Your brain links tones on the basis of proximity and believes there is a forever ascending scale. <br>
                    
                    Shepard scales can be found in music and a variety of sound effects. 
                    It is used for the Batpod in the Dark Knight as well as to create extreme tension in the film Dunkirk. 
                    Other notable examples can be found in the stairs in Super Mario and in Pink Floyd's song Echoes.
