                <b>What is it? </b> 
                <br>
                Three tones are played that ascend in pitch; they are then looped. The timbre (sound quality) is altered for each adjacent note. 
                When this new sequence is played, you may hear interwoven descending patterns rather than the original ascending pattern.

                <b>How does this work? </b> 
                <br>
                Generally, we assume that our brain group different notes based on their frequency or by their location and often this is correct. 
                In this instance, Wessel demonstrated that the brain groups the notes based on their timbre.
                There are two timbres present and the brain groups the set of notes into two distinct groups.
                In these groups, there is a descending pattern and so you hear interwoven descending patterns rather than an ascending pattern.

                <br>
                <b>What does this mean? </b>
                <br>
                The illusion shows that our brain segregates different sounds using a number of factors, and one of those is timbre. 
                <br>
                Researchers are attempting to understand what exactly timbre comprises of. 
                <br>
                Some have hypothesised it is actually the spectral density of complex tones that our brain uses to group sounds. 
                The spectral density is a factor incorporated by timbre<sup>1</sup>.
                <br>
                The findings are relevant to our understanding of speech recognition, which is useful for developing better speech recognition software as well as hardware, such as hearing aids.

                <br>
                <b>What are the details of research?</b>
                <br>
                A lot of the research looks at accurately defining exactly what timbre is. 
                The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) defines timbre as<sup>2</sup>
                <br>
                “Timbre. That attribute of auditory sensation which enables a listener to judge that two nonidentical sounds, similarly presented and having the same loudness and pitch, 
                are dissimilar. Timbre depends primarily upon the frequency spectrum, although it also depends upon the sound pressure and the temporal characteristics of the sound.”
                <br>
                <br>
                Siedenburg and McAdams wrote a paper that disagrees with this definition and instead outlines four distinctions that place timbre as a highly perceptual concept rather than one that can be physically identified<sup>3</sup>. 
                Other studies have looked at how timbre and spectral density are related. 
                The importance of understanding timbre and how we process it is not unnoticed. For example, it would help develop our systems for speech recognition and hearing aids; improving the lives of many. 
                <br>
                <br>
                A study by Rayo et al (2019) looked at using timbre to improve the effectiveness of alarms in the clinical settings. For example, in hospitals alarms sound to signal urgent cardiac problems, respiratory problems or just to call for a nurse. Healthcare practitioners are trained to distinguish each alarm so they can decide how to respond to them, however currently, alarms only differ by pitch and loudness and nurses struggle to consistently identify them. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The research group looked at differing their alarms groups by timbre. They tested their identifiability on 20 nurses across four hospitals and compared to current alarm systems. 
                <br>
                They found identifiability of the timbre alarm group was higher than the baseline alarm system. It is an interesting utilisation of timbre to improve a system<sup>4</sup>.
