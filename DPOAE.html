                <b>What is this? </b>
                <br>
                Two tones are played. One remains constant and the other continually rises in pitch. 
                You may hear a very faint mysterious tone that is lower than the sounds that are played and is in fact falling in pitch. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>How does this happen?</b> 
                <br>
                The inner ear vibrates when sound waves travel through it. 
                If there are two frequencies vibrating the inner ear, they interact and the inner ear produces distortion products; this is a result of its nonlinearity. 
                Let’s say you have two tones that have frequencies f1 and f2. 
                A simple distortion product to calculate is the cubic product (2f1 - f2). 
                In the example, as f2 rises, this particular distortion product will actually fall in pitch. 
                This is the tone that you might hear and is produced by your own ear! The phenomenon is best shown by the diagram below, produced in Matlab.

                <br>
                <b>Is this used anywhere?</b>
                <br>
                Yes. It is used in healthcare to test the function of the inner ear. 
                Clinicians play two tones and use a microphone to listen for the cubic distortion product (2f1 -f2) produced by the inner ear. 
                It’s absence is a strong indication of inner ear impairment<sup>1</sup> . 
                DPOAEs are also utilised in music and often referred to as combination tones or Tartini tones<sup>2</sup>. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What is in the detailed research?</b>  
                <br>
                This is a widely researched topic that along the way has illuminated some of the incredible intricacies and functionality of the ear. 
                We will explore how nonlinearity of the ear, specifically the cochlea, is relevant to DPOAEs and hearing in general<sup>3</sup>. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="img/dp2.png">
                <br>
                <br>
                The cochlea is essential to inner ear function and research has shown that it actively alters sound waves as they travel through the ear to later stimulate neuronal activity. 
                These active processes can be split into four distinct actions;
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Amplification</li>
                    <li>Frequency tuning</li>
                    <li>Compressive nonlinearity</li>
                    <li>Spontaneous otoacoustic emission</li>
                </ul>
                Amplification is considered the most important. 
                It should be noted the process is coined active because ear components input their own internal energy. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The motility and contraction of outer hair cells are key to amplify sounds. 
                They rapidly contract causing downward movement of the tectorial membrane and upward movement of the basilar membrane. 
                This process helps us to hear quieter sounds and improve frequency resolution. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It is due to this nonlinearity and active processes that DPOAEs are produced. 
                When they are not present it is a strong indicator the cochlea and outer hair cells are not functioning properly. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of the research has determined the best conditions for DPOAEs and their clinical purposes. 
                Currently, two high frequency tones are used measuring frequencies up to around 6kHz, and the ratio of the two tones (f1/f2) is kept around 1.22. 
                They are played at amplitudes 55dB and 65dB SPL; these conditions are met to maximise the DPOAEs measured<sup>4</sup> . 
                <br>
                <br>
                Despite this maximisation, there is a relatively high rate of false positive tests, particularly for newborn babies. 
                It is thought that remaining amniotic fluid in the middle ear may be accountable. 
                A recent study looked at measuring higher frequencies, up to 12kHz, as these are less affected by the amniotic fluid<sup>4</sup>.
                They found that using additional frequencies up to 10kHz cut the false positive rate from 9% to 0.4%. 
                The study had its limitation but it shows how valuable it is to improve this diagnostic test.
