                <b>What are they?</b>
                <br>
                Using headphones, the left and right ears are played continuous tones of slightly differing frequencies. 
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                An illusory ‘beat’ is heard at the average frequency of tones. 
                The amplitude, which is related to loudness, increases and decreases with a frequency equal to the difference between the tones.<sup>1</sup> 
                It is this frequency difference that is important.

                Believe it or not, binaural beats were first discovered in the 1800s using long tubes to carry the ringing of tuning forks to the separate ears. 
                It was only in the 1970s however that their clinical potential was first highlighted. <sup>1</sup>
                Today, binaural beats are used to ease anxiety, improve focus, help induce sleep or manage pain. <sup>2</sup>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>How do they occur?</b>
                <br>
                You may believe sounds arriving at the left and right ears are processed and perceived separately from one another. 
                In fact, it is often important the auditory system combines these inputs. 
                For example, when following a conversation in a noisy room, one ear may pick up more speech than the other. 
                To give you the best chance of making sense of the conversation, data from the separate ears is integrated in the brainstem before making its way to higher auditory cortices as a single unified percept. <sup>3</sup>
                Scientists call this process binaural integration and it is an important adaptation. For binaural beats it seems this integration primarily occurs in the superior olivary nuclei of the brainstem. <sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup>

                <b>How are they useful?</b>
                <br>
                Since the 1970s binaural beats have been studied and used as a tool for brainwave entrainment. 
                The goal is to synchronise the frequency of brainwaves to a periodic external stimulus, enabling us to influence the perceiver’s state of consciousness. <sup>5</sup>
                The entraining frequency is not the average of the two tones however, but the frequency difference between them! 
                Typically, this is between 0.5 and 40 Hz, depending on the desired effect.
                <br>
                <br>
                Brainwaves have been studied for many years and are merely patterns of rhythmic electrical activity between different regions of the brain. 
                They are classified in to five main categories depending on their frequency. Each category is associated with different states of brain activity and function, outlined in the table below. <sup>6</sup>
                <br>

                        <td>Very relaxed, passive attention</td>

                        <td>0.5 - 4 Hz</td>
                        <td>Sleep</td>

                Many experiments have now been conducted investigating the therapeutic benefits of various forms of brain entrainment, which may be visual, auditory or even tactile. 
                While these therapies are not yet prescribed by clinicians, binaural beat audio is gaining an online following. Sites like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://idoser.net/">idoser.net</a> sell a vast range of tracks which promise anything from improved focus to the hallucinogenic effects of popular illegal drugs. <sup>7</sup>
                Binaural beat music can also be found on Youtube.
                <br>
                <br>
                A 2018 meta-analysis evaluating 22 studies concluded there was robust evidence to suggest binaural auditory beats can affect pain perception, memory, concentration and anxiety. <sup>5</sup> 
                Entraining frequencies of the gamma, beta and alpha bands improve concentration and memory, whilst delta and theta frequencies reduce anxiety; following the natural brain states associated with these frequency ranges, if entrainment was successful this would make sense.
                <br>
                <br> 
                To maximise their effect, users should listen to the tracks for a minimum of 5-10 minutes, ideally for an hour. 
                Care must also be taken to ensure the beat is not obscured by foreground noise such as accompanying music. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For now, binaural beats remain predominantly in the realms of self-therapy and alternative medicine, however this illusion holds promise for clinical use in the future. 
                Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, chronic pain and trouble sleeping are some examples of conditions that may be treated with this therapy. 
                Additionally, those who wish to reap some of the benefits of meditation might also find these tracks useful.
