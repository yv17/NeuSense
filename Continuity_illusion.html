                <b>What is it?</b>
                <br>
                The continuity illusion takes place when a gap in a discontinuous auditory stimulus is filled with “noise”. As the name suggests, the stimulus is misperceived to be continuous. This stimulus can be anything from a simple pure tone to more complex music or speech. <sup>1</sup>
                <br>
                <br>
                <audio controls>
                    <source src="sound_files/continuity.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                </audio>
                <br>
                <br>
                Noise is the word we use for unwanted sounds that interfere with our hearing of sounds of interest. Without noise, when silence fills the gap, the continuity illusion cannot occur. <sup>2</sup>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>What mechanism underlie the illusion?</b>
                <br>
                When listening to a friend speak in a noisy room, we can make sense of what they say even when parts of words are obscured by the background noise. One enabler of this is the continuity illusion.
                <br>
                <br>
                Evidence shows ‘top-down’ expectations are important in modulating this process – this means what you hear is in part determined by what you expect to hear! These expectations are based on your previous experiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                For example, studies have shown the continuity illusion is more prominent when listening to discontinuous known words than ‘psuedowords’, which are meaningless word-like sounds. <sup>3</sup>
                Similarly, gaps in familiar songs are more often overlooked than within unfamiliar songs. <sup>4</sup>
                Communication between the auditory cortex and memory centres (in the right medial temporal lobe and basal region) facilitates the illusion in these cases. <sup>5</sup>
                In summary, you hear a song with gaps throughout but you already know the words; your memory of the song is used to ‘fill-in’ the missing sound and you believe the lyrics are continuous!
                <br>
                <br>
                While higher brain regions are recruited to maintain complicated percepts, like in the case of illusory music described above, oftentimes the illusion can be maintained by early auditory cortical processing alone. 
                A 2007 study using monkeys found that the responses of neurons in the primary auditory cortex were identical for both interrupted and continuous tones – in both cases the neurons responded as if the noise was continuous. <sup>2</sup> 
                The same thing was seen in 2016 with EEG analysis of the brainstem. <sup>6</sup>
                Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the illusion may occur regardless of whether the listener is paying close attention to the interrupted sound or not. <sup>7</sup>
                <br>
                <br>
                With so many mechanisms in place to uphold this illusion it is clear it must serve a useful purpose to organisms. 
                In fact the continuity illusion (also referred to as auditory induction or temporal restoration) is demonstrated across a wide range of species and is a well-conserved tool that enables us to make sense of sounds of interest when disrupted by immaterial background noise. 
                This distinguishes it from other illusions, which may just be fascinating peculiarities, as it has been directly selected for and preserved throughout our evolution.

                <b>Future applications of research in this area?</b>
                <br>
                Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying the continuity illusion remains a research focus. One prospective application of this research may be to further elucidate the pathophysiology underlying tinnitus, a disorder in which a person has an increased tendency to hear phantom sounds.
                <br>
                <br>
                In continuity illusion studies it has been seen that listeners have a higher tendency to experience phantom sounds when a certain type of brainwave, alpha oscillations, are reduced. <sup>5</sup>
                It has been suggested that cortical alpha waves play a role in selective auditory inhibition, allowing us to extract the useful information from noisy sound signals.  
                Interestingly, reduced alpha wave activity is also observed in tinnitus patients however little is known about what role this plays within the pathogenesis. <sup>8</sup>
