            <b>What is it?</b>
            <br>
            The mysterious melody illusion was first discovered in 1972 by Diana Deutsch. <sup>1</sup>
            A familiar tune was modified so that the notes were randomly scattered between three different octaves. 
            This made the tune difficult to identify, however once told the name of the tune listeners could recognise it easily. 
            Listen to our recreation of the illusion here.

            <b>What does this tell us about human hearing?</b>
            <br>
            The most important factors that determine our ability to recognise a familiar tune are:
            <ul>
                <li>the pattern of rising and falling pitch</li>
                <li>the intervals between notes</li>
                <li>the pitch chroma of the notes (read more about pitch chroma <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="Shepard_tone.html">here</a>) <sup>2</sup></li>
            </ul>
            In this experiment Deutsh transposed familiar melodies, preserving intervals and pitch chroma but randomly changing which octave each note was played in (its pitch height) and therefore changing the tune’s pattern of rising and falling pitch. 
            Subjects were unable to identify these transposed melodies, which tells us pitch chroma and note intervals are insufficient cues for tune recognition on their own. 
            <br>
            <br>
            However, when given ‘prior information’ - the name of the tune - subjects were able to utilise the pitch chroma and interval information to identify the melodies. 
            This demonstrates what neurologists call top-down processing; the use of prior knowledge and context when processing stimuli. 
            This is a very important and ubiquitous concept in neurology. 
            Our nervous system is adapted to harvest the most information possible from stimuli through complex interlinking of its networks, and scientists are still working towards a full understanding of the complicated neural mechanisms behind tune recognition.
