                        Auditory illusions, also known as auditory pareidolia, occur when misperceiving real acoustic stimuli. 
                        This definition creates a distinction from auditory hallucinations, which are perceived in the absence of a stimulus.

                        <br>
                        Auditory illusions allow us to perceive sounds which are not present in the stimulus, 
                        similar to how optical illusions allow us to see objects or shapes that are not present in an image.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are multiple examples of musical illusions that you may or may not notice in music pieces 
                        like Tchaikovsky’s Passage and The Beethoven’s Leonore Overture or famous movies such as Dunkirk and The Dark Knight.

                    <p>One interesting fact about auditory illusion is that different people will have different perception for the same illusions. 
                        There is simply no right or wrong answer. 
                        The factors that determine how you perceive auditory illusion include your neurological functions, psychological state, musical training, handedness and even the language that you speak.
