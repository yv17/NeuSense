            <b>What is the Galloping Rhythm?</b>
            <br> 
            In this illusion you hear one rhythm that maintains a constant pitch and a different rhythm that changes in pitch. 
            As the pitch of the two rhythms come very close together, you may perceive a single melody that sounds like a galloping rhythm, instead of two disjointed melodies.

            <b>What is going on?</b>
            <br>
            The illusion provides a good demonstration of how humans segregate different notes based on their pitch. 
            Researchers such as Albert Bregman and Leon van Noorden studied the perceptual organisation of sound; 
            they state that we associate sounds of a similar pitch as coming from the same source. 
            When there are distinct different pitches, our brain assumes they come from different sources.
            <br>
            <br>
            The galloping rhythm consists of alternating notes - ABA. 
            When the pitch difference between A and B is small, they are perceived as one melody as though coming from one source. 
            When the pitch difference is large, they seem to form two distinct melodies as if coming from different sources. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Is any of this important? </b>
            <br> 
            Yes. Our understanding of auditory grouping has the potential to impact multiple disciplines. 
            For example, musical composers have been fascinated by our ability to group sounds for years and it can help them produce incredible music. 
            It also helps engineers to produce better speech recognition systems both in computers and in cochlear implants.
