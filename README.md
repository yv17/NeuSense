# NeuSense-Trial

Hi friends!

This is a repo to just try out some stuff and for easy code sharing

1. Home page: Title of our project, "logo", and button to explore work

2. Overview of all illusions (tiles page): Tiles for each illusion with (maybe) a summary of what they are. Goes to illusion page upon clicking

3. Each illusion page (confirm how many total?): Title of illusion, description of illusion, poll, and on top a menu including a drop-down menu to select other illusions

4. Overview of all statistics (maybe?): Graphs of everything

5. Team page: Our group!!
