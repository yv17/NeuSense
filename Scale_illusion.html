                What is it?
                <br>
                <br>
                An ascending scale and a descending scale are played simultaneously. 
                The notes from the ascending scale alternate from left to right ear; the same occurs for the notes from the descending scale. 
                Your brain may make order out of the chaos that is presented. 
                <br>
                <br>
                How does it work? 
                <br>
                <br>
                It is thought that your brain groups together sounds that have a similar pitch and makes the reasonable assumption that they come from the same source. 
                As a result, despite the chaos created by alternating the scale side to side, your brain orders this into two groups of related notes. 
                Research shows that right handers most often hear the higher note melody on the right side and the lower melody on the left. 
                The perceived pattern for left handers can vary greatly. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It is useful? 
                <br>
                <br>
                The illusion can be found in the Sixth Symphony by Tchaikovsky. 
                He alternates the notes for the piece between two sets of instruments that are physically apart on stage. 
                However, the audience perceives an ordered melody where the theme is produced by one set of instruments and the accompaniment by the other. 
                This is different from the alternating pattern played by the ensemble. 
                There is ongoing research to elucidate areas of the brain responsible for organising sound. For example, a 2016 research paper (Kuriki et al, 2016) suggested evidence that an area posterior to the auditory cortex is responsible for perception of the scale illusion. 
                <br>
                <br>
                What are the details of further research? 
                <br>
                <br>
                In the previously mentioned 2016 study by Kuriki et al, the researchers analysed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 23 volunteers.
                They separately played each volunteer the original scale illusion and another melody that mimicked the ordered perception of the scale illusion. 
                <br>
                By comparing the fMRI activation areas they identified and hypothesised that areas A1 (part of the auditory cortex) and the planum temporale (posterior to the auditory cortex) were involved in producing the illusory effect.
                <br> 
                The planum temporale was of particular interest; they linked back to previous studies to suggest what function it might be undertaking. 
                <br>
                The planum temporale may act to determine whether a sequence of tones are moving upward or downward in pitch. 
                Whereas determination of the actual pitch and changes in pitch (but not of sequences) occurs in the auditory cortex and Heschlâ€™s Gyrus. 
                <br>
                The planum temporale has been the subject of previous studies that have linked its structure and symmetry to absolute pitch as well as sound location.
